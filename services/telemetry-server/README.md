# Telemetry Server

The telemetry server runs independently of the rest of the project and supports opt-in collection of user feedback and application performance monitoring signaling to support A/B testing of alternative design tokens, loaders and plugins, routines used in conjunction with the base Bundler UI library.

In actuality, this may (or may not) be a little overkill for a project of this size, but it's a good opportunity to learn about the process of setting up a telemetry server and the potential benefits of using one. Right now, it is a future work in progress.
