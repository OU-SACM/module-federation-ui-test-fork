# Module-Federation-UI

Module Federation UI provides developer-accessible, node-based components to formally illustrate widely-used *tooling* (e.g. package managers, task runners, static module bundlers) and *patterns* (e.g. caching, backend-for-frontends, server-side-rendering, static-site-generation) for building **micro-frontend** based applications using **federated modules**. Its design goals are fundamentally motivated to progressively disclose the complexity of these systems to developers and stakeholders, and to provide a visual language for describing these systems for educational content, system documentation, performance tuning applications, and the everyday tooling used by developers who ship products relying on static module bundlers and content delivery networks.

Components are highly influenced by concepts developed in "[Practical Module Federation](https://module-federation.myshopify.com/products/practical-module-federation)" by Jack Herrington and Zack Jackson as well as "[Micro Frontends in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/micro-frontends-in-action?a_aid=mfia&a_bid=5f09fdeb)" by Michael Geers. In fact, many examples in this library translate figures and diagrams from these books into reusable, interactive components.
