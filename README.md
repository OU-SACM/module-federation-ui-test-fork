# Module-Federation-UI

Module Federation UI provides visual node-based UI components depicting widely-used *tooling* (**task runners** and **static module bundlers**) and *patterns* for building **micro-frontend** applications using federated modules. Its design goals are fundamentally motivated to progressively disclose the complexity of these systems to developers and stakeholders, and to provide a visual language for creating educational content, system documentation, interactive development tools, and dynamic build performance tuning systems for HMR systems and content delivery networks.

Components are highly influenced by concepts developed in "[Practical Module Federation](https://module-federation.myshopify.com/products/practical-module-federation)" by Jack Herrington and Zack Jackson as well as "[Micro Frontends in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/micro-frontends-in-action?a_aid=mfia&a_bid=5f09fdeb)" by Michael Geers. In fact, many examples in this library translate figures and diagrams from these books into reusable, interactive components.
