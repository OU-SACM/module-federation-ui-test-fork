# Bundler UI
Bundler UI provides developer-accessible, node-based components to formally illustrate widely-used *tooling* (e.g. package managers, task runners, static module bundlers) and *patterns* (e.g. dependency-graphs, rendering-graphs, caching, chunks, backend-for-frontends, server-side-rendering, static-site-generation) for compiling **micro-frontend** build artifacts and serving these over content-delivery networks using **federated modules**. Individually, components represent well-formed terms that combine to form an expressive visual language of the actual abstractions used by developers for shipping products over content delivery networks. Overall, this project aims to support future downstream products including but not limited to performance-tuning applications, system documentation, and tooling for integrated development environments.

Components are highly influenced by concepts developed in "[Practical Module Federation](https://module-federation.myshopify.com/products/practical-module-federation)" by Jack Herrington and Zack Jackson as well as "[Micro Frontends in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/micro-frontends-in-action?a_aid=mfia&a_bid=5f09fdeb)" by Michael Geers. Many examples in this library translate figures and diagrams from these books into reusable, interactive components.
